# Dialog Editor

This repository is used to handle issues and publish the latest releases of the editor.

# Download
You can find all available versions of the application in the [Releases](https://github.com/rayofhope-dev/dialog-editor/releases) tab.

# Get Started

- Run **xrSDK.Editor.DialogEditor.App.exe**. 
> It may be blocked by the Windows Defender, because the executable file is nog signed. But this warning can be safely bypassed.
- Select **File** -> **Open Game directory**.
- Select the root directory containing the `gamedata` folder.

Please, note:
- The editor will try to use standard COP paths to dialogs and localization files. If the files are not found, you will be prompted to specify the paths to them manually;
- The editor supports 2 localizations: `eng` and `ru`. You can switch between them in the settings.
